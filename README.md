# CasePortal - Django Case Management Portal

## Project Overview
CasePortal is a Django-based web application designed to streamline the management of various types of cases. It provides features like digital scheduling of hearings, document management, and notifications, improving efficiency and transparency in case management.

Traditional case management relies on manual processes which lead to delays, inefficiencies, and scattered information. This project automates these processes in a simple, user-friendly portal.

## Features
- User authentication (login/logout)
- Add, view, and manage cases
- Schedule hearings for cases
- Upload and manage case-related documents
- Dashboard with total, ongoing, and closed cases
- Notifications for new hearings
- Secure access: Only authenticated users can manage their own cases


## Technologies Used
- Backend: Python, Django  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap  
- Database: SQLite (default Django DB)  
- Version Control: Git & GitHub
